//! `LayerNormChip`: backs the `LayerNorm` instruction (see `crate::isa`) --
//! layer normalization over a fixed, compile-time-known count `K` of I18
//! inputs:
//!
//! ```text
//! mean     = (1/K) * sum_i x_i
//! variance = (1/K) * sum_i (x_i - mean)^2
//! output_i = (x_i - mean) * rsqrt(variance + epsilon)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Scope: no learnable affine parameters
//!
//! This chip deliberately does **not** implement the usual `gamma * output_i +
//! beta` learnable affine transform that follows normalization in most real
//! layer-norm implementations. That is an explicit, deliberate scope decision
//! for this foundation layer (not an oversight): `gamma`/`beta` would just be
//! one more `EltwiseMulChip`/`EltwiseAddChip` pair per output element once
//! per-channel weight vectors are threaded through the ISA, and adding that
//! is straightforward follow-up work once the surrounding instruction set
//! has a place to carry those learned weights. Keeping this chip to the
//! normalization core (mean/variance/rsqrt/rescale) keeps it composable and
//! easy to verify in isolation first.
//!
//! ## Composition strategy
//!
//! Structurally this chip is a pipeline of already-existing, already-sound
//! building blocks, threaded together the same way
//! [`crate::chips::patch_embed::PatchEmbedChip`] reuses a single configured
//! [`crate::chips::dot_general::DotProductChip`] across several sequential
//! regions rather than configuring independent copies:
//!
//! 1. [`crate::chips::reduce::ReduceMeanChip`] computes `mean` over the `K`
//!    inputs.
//! 2. [`crate::chips::eltwise::EltwiseAddChip`] computes each `diff_i = x_i -
//!    mean` (as `x_i + (-mean)`, since subtraction is just addition with a
//!    host-negated operand -- I18's field-natural sign handling means no new
//!    circuit machinery is needed for this).
//! 3. [`crate::chips::eltwise::EltwiseMulChip`] computes each `sq_i =
//!    diff_i^2` (`diff_i * diff_i`).
//! 4. The **same** `ReduceMeanChip` instance (reused, not reconfigured --
//!    it's data-independent: mean of `K` values is mean of `K` values,
//!    whether they're the raw inputs or their squared deviations) computes
//!    `variance` over the `sq_i` values.
//! 5. `EltwiseAddChip` (the same instance again) adds the constant `epsilon`
//!    to `variance`.
//! 6. A small dedicated [`RsqrtChip`] (a thin lookup-backed wrapper in the
//!    exact spirit of [`crate::chips::gelu::GeluChip`]) looks up
//!    `rsqrt(variance + epsilon) = 1 / sqrt(variance + epsilon)`.
//! 7. `EltwiseMulChip` (the same instance used for squaring) computes each
//!    `output_i = diff_i * rsqrt_value`.
//!
//! ## Soundness: linking cells across composed-chip boundaries
//!
//! [`crate::chips::eltwise::EltwiseAddChip::assign`] and
//! [`crate::chips::eltwise::EltwiseMulChip::assign`] now return an
//! `AssignedCell` for their output (mirroring
//! [`crate::chips::dot_general::DotProductChip::assign`] and
//! [`crate::chips::reduce::ReduceMeanChip::assign`]), and
//! [`crate::chips::reduce::ReduceMeanChip::assign`] additionally returns the
//! per-input `AssignedCell`s it re-witnesses internally. `LayerNormChip`'s
//! own `assign` still independently recomputes each intermediate host-side
//! value (`diff_i`, `sq_i`, `variance_plus_eps`, `output_i`), but critically
//! it **also** ties every one of those recomputed values' cells back to the
//! producing chip's real cell via `region.constrain_equal` -- exactly the
//! same discipline [`crate::chips::softmax::SoftmaxChip`] applies one level
//! down (see that module's docs), applied here one level up across five more
//! composed chip calls. Two wrinkles specific to this chip, not present in
//! `SoftmaxChip`:
//!
//! - `EltwiseAddChip`'s `a`/`b`/`c` columns all hold the *signed-shifted*
//!   representation (`raw + 2^63`), while `EltwiseMulChip`'s `a`/`b` and
//!   `crate::chips::lookup::LookupChip`'s `input`/`output` hold the
//!   *unshifted* natural representation -- so a value produced in shifted
//!   form (e.g. `diff_i`, out of `EltwiseAddChip`) needs a small dedicated
//!   "unshift bridge" gadget (a linear gate `unshifted + 2^63 == shifted`)
//!   before it can be tied into an unshifted consumer. See `assign_unshift`
//!   below.
//! - Computing `diff_i = x_i - mean` needs `-mean` as an operand, but
//!   `mean`'s only produced cell holds the shifted `mean_raw + 2^63`; a
//!   small dedicated "negation bridge" gate (`neg_mean_shift + mean_shift ==
//!   2 * 2^63`) ties a freshly witnessed shifted `-mean` cell back to the
//!   real mean cell. See the `s_neg_mean` gate below.
//!
//! Because `EltwiseAddChip::assign`/`EltwiseMulChip::assign` only expose
//! their *output* cell (not their `a`/`b` input cells), the specific
//! Add/Mul rows that need their *input* cells linked (the diff computation,
//! the variance+epsilon computation, and both squaring/scaling
//! multiplications) are assigned directly against `EltwiseAddConfig`'s and
//! `EltwiseMulConfig`'s columns/selectors (`assign_add_row`/
//! `assign_mul_row` below) rather than through `EltwiseAddChip::assign`/
//! `EltwiseMulChip::assign` as black boxes -- mirroring the precedent
//! `DotProductConfig` already set for this in `dot_general.rs`.
//!
//! ## CRITICAL NUMERIC LIMITATION -- I18's representable range
//!
//! I18 is backed by a plain `i64` at scale `10^18`, giving a representable
//! range of only about `±9.22` in real terms (`i64::MAX / 1e18`), with **no**
//! wider accumulator type at the host level for this chip's intermediate
//! values. Every one of `x_i`, `mean`, `variance`, `rsqrt(variance +
//! epsilon)`, and each `output_i` must individually stay within that range,
//! or the corresponding `requantize_mul`/`checked_add` call inside `assign`
//! panics (`.expect(...)`) rather than silently wrapping.
//!
//! This chip's own tests use `K = 4` and inputs in `[-1.5, 1.5]`, which keeps
//! every intermediate comfortably in range: `diff_i` up to `3.0` in
//! magnitude, `sq_i` up to `9.0` (well under `9.22`, but leaves very little
//! headroom -- a wider input range would risk overflowing the square step
//! well before it overflows the inputs themselves), `variance` a mean of
//! those squares (so no larger than the largest square), and
//! `rsqrt(variance + epsilon)` bounded by the *lower* end of the domain (see
//! below). Callers choosing their own `K`/input ranges must re-derive these
//! bounds for their own case; nothing here checks them beyond the panics
//! `requantize_mul`/`checked_add` raise on actual overflow.
//!
//! ## CRITICAL NUMERIC LIMITATION -- the rsqrt lookup domain
//!
//! `rsqrt(v) = 1/sqrt(v)` blows up as `v -> 0`, so the domain lower bound
//! must be chosen carefully: e.g. `rsqrt(0.0001) = 100`, which already
//! overflows I18's `~9.22` range on its own, long before any multiplication
//! by `diff_i` even happens. This chip's tests use a domain of `[0.1, 3.0]`,
//! giving `rsqrt` outputs in `[rsqrt(3.0), rsqrt(0.1)] ~= [0.577, 3.162]` --
//! comfortably within range with a wide margin.
//!
//! This means, as a real and deliberately-not-silently-papered-over
//! limitation of this foundation layer: **if the true `variance + epsilon`
//! for a given `K` inputs falls below the configured domain's lower bound
//! (e.g. all `K` inputs nearly identical, driving `variance` towards zero),
//! [`LayerNormChip::assign`] returns [`LayerNormError::Rsqrt`] rather than a
//! result**, because [`crate::chips::lookup::LookupChip`] only proves
//! membership of an *exact* quantized domain point -- it has no "nearest
//! point" snapping or extrapolation. Widening the domain outward (lower
//! `rsqrt_domain_min`) is the fix for callers who need to support
//! near-degenerate (very low variance) inputs, at the cost of needing a
//! larger `rsqrt_domain_n` to keep the same quantization density, and of
//! `rsqrt`'s own output-range headroom shrinking as the lower bound drops.
//!
//! Relatedly, because [`crate::chips::lookup::LookupChip::assign`] requires
//! its query to be an *exact* point of the quantized domain (not merely
//! within `[rsqrt_domain_min, rsqrt_domain_max]`), a `variance + epsilon`
//! that falls strictly between two domain grid points is *also* rejected
//! with [`LayerNormError::Rsqrt`] -- exactly the same "quantization grid"
//! limitation already present in [`crate::chips::gelu::GeluChip`] (see that
//! module's docs). Production use of this foundation layer needs either a
//! much finer grid tuned to the upstream quantization scheme in use, or a
//! "snap to nearest domain point plus a proximity proof" mechanism -- future
//! work, out of scope here.
//!
//! ## CRITICAL NUMERIC LIMITATION -- epsilon's milli-unit granularity
//!
//! Per [`crate::isa::Instruction::LayerNorm`]'s `epsilon_milli` field,
//! epsilon is expressed as `epsilon_milli as f64 / 1000.0`, i.e. in
//! thousandths. That gives a minimum representable epsilon of `0.001`, far
//! coarser than the tiny epsilons (typically `1e-5` to `1e-8`) real-world
//! layer-norm implementations use to guard against division by (near) zero.
//! This is an accepted limitation of the current milli-unit ISA convention,
//! not something this chip works around -- a finer-grained epsilon
//! convention would need a wider integer field or the sort of `I18`-based
//! (rather than milli-unit) epsilon input this codebase's other constants
//! use elsewhere.
